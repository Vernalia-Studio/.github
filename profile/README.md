# 🏛️ VERNALIA // THE REGISTRY
### [STATUS: OPERATIONAL] // [ACCESS: PUBLIC_VIVISECTION]

Vernalia is a boutique creative technology studio specializing in **High-Fidelity Digital Rituals** and **Fossilized Infrastructure**. We build the specialized architecture that sits between a website and an experience. 

Through the **Vitrification Protocol**, we transform ephemeral web interactions into permanent digital artifacts—optimized for speed, hardened against decay, and designed for Mischief.

### THE ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY
We believe the modern web has become too frictionless. We build **Gates** that require intention to pass.

* **The Ritual:** Every interaction is a performance. We measure the Friction Index to ensure the challenge is perfectly tuned.
* **The Fossil:** We do not build sites. We build self-contained, serverless archives designed to survive the erosion of the open web.
* **The Intelligence:** Real-time observability via the **Nerve Center**, turning user struggle into actionable telemetry.

### CAPABILITIES // THE CORE STACK
Our internal logic is built for surgical precision and high-physics sequences.

* **Surgical Dispatching:** Modular JS specimens initialized with zero-overhead.
* **Vitrification Engine:** Automated asset optimization (WebP/WebM) with frame-accurate synchronization.
* **Edge Hardening:** Global deployment via the Netlify Edge network for sub-0.8s FCP.
* **Cryptographic Logging:** Every build is assigned a unique Registry ID for historical audit.

### REPOSITORY DIRECTORY
* **[internal] core-architecture:** The private blueprints of the Vernalia Protocol.
* **[internal] registry-archives:** Bespoke project deployments for high-profile commissions.
* **[public] studio-standards:** Open-source CSS resets and JS utility specimens for the curious.
